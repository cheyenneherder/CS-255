# CS-255
In the following, you will see two different files. One is the business requirements document and the other is the system design document. The client, DriverPass, aimed to have a resource that will help their
students with a way to schedule on-the-road training with staff, have a way to practice/take quizzes and/or tests, and pay for the packages of their choice all in one place.
As for what I believe I did well for my client, is I took the time and effort to scan the interview notes and create them into use cases. I wanted to show relationships and functions as clearly as possibly.
It is very important to consider and implement the user's needs into the system's design. What I did specifically for DriverPass, however, is I created a user-centered design. To create an effective system,
it is essential to do this. The business requirements document serves as the base for understanding such needs. As you can see from the UML Case Diagram, I showed key interactions that the users will engage
with. It shows a clear visual representation of the system's functions and how this alligns with goals.
A good approach when designing software, is to create a system that meets the specified requirements and is both maintainable and functional.
